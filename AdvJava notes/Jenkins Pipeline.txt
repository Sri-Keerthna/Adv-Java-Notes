JENKINS PIPELINE:
what are jenkin pipeline

Jenkins is an automation engine which supports a no of automation patterns.
It supports simple Contionous Integration to comprehensive CD Pipelines

Pipeline Concepts:

PIPELINE - has a series of sequence of commands which is a part of stages
stages has a set of steps

CI/CD pipeline:
@----------------@----------------@
Build-----------Test-------------Deploy
these 3 are stages 
@-->node 
NODE - it can be randomly noted to slave
eg : node1 - code execute
node 2 - test
node 3- deploy

PIPELINE SCRIPTING :
Types:
Declarative pipline - always use declarative pipeline bcz it is refined and explicit
Scripted pipeline (first developed by jenkin bt it is out dated).

Declarative pipeline eg prgms:

pipleine{
agent any //any available Slave nodes for execution
stages {
stage('Build'){
steps{
sh 'make' //sh-shell bcz they are linux command 'make' is a msg
}
}
stage('Test'){
steps{
//
}
}
stage('Deploy'){
steps{
//
}
}
}
}

-->pipeline(Declarative pipeline-specific) ->A pipelien's code defines ur entire build process,which typically includes stages for building an app,testing it and deleibvering it.

-->agent ->defines jenkind =s to allocate an execeutor and a workspace for the entire pipeline

-->steps-->single task

-->junit is an another pipeline step(provided bu the junit plugin) for aggregating test reports

-->node is a machine which is the part of the jenkin environment and is capable of executing a pipeline

-->stage-->stage block defines a conceptual distinct subset of tasks peformes through the entire pipeline
